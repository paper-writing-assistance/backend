    "abstract": "We present in this paper a new architecture, named Con-\nvolutional vision Transformer (CvT), that improves Vision\nTransformer (ViT) in performance and efficiency by intro-\nducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both de-\nsigns. This is accomplished through two primary modifica-\ntions: a hierarchy of Transformers containing a new convo-\nlutional token embedding, and a convolutional Transformer\nblock leveraging a convolutional projection. These changes\nintroduce desirable properties of convolutional neural net-\nworks (CNNs) to the ViT architecture (i.e. shift, scale,\nand distortion invariance) while maintaining the merits of\nTransformers (i.e. dynamic attention, global context, and\nbetter generalization). We validate CvT by conducting ex-\ntensive experiments, showing that this approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance over other Vision Transform-\ners and ResNets on ImageNet-1k, with fewer parame-\nters and lower FLOPs. In addition, performance gains\nare maintained when pretrained on larger datasets (e.g.\nImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream tasks. Pre-\ntrained on ImageNet-22k, our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 ac-\ncuracy of 87.7% on the ImageNet-1k val set. Finally, our\nresults show that the positional encoding, a crucial com-\nponent in existing Vision Transformers, can be safely re-\nmoved in our model, simplifying the design for higher res-\nolution vision tasks.

    "abstract": "This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are\nscalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our\nMAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the\ninput image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based\non two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric\nencoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that oper-\nates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask to-\nkens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs\nthe original image from the latent representation and mask\ntokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion\nof the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and\nmeaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two de-\nsigns enables us to train large models efficiently and ef-\nfectively: we accelerate training (by 3x or more) and im-\nprove accuracy.

By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only\na few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely\nstruggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic,\nfew-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-\ntuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion\nparameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in\nthe few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning,\nwith tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3\nachieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and\ncloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as\nunscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same\ntime, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some\ndatasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally,\nwe find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty\ndistinguishing from articles written by humans.

(1) It\ncan cope with various image sizes. (2) It achieves linear computational com-\nplexity to image size by using local windows. In contrast, previous MLPs have\nO(N2) computations due to fully spatial connections. We build a family of\nmodels which surpass existing MLPs and even state-of-the-art Transformer-based\nmodels, e.g. Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021b), while using fewer parame-\nters and FLOPs.

    "abstract": "Abstract-State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations.\nAdvances like SPPnet [1] and Fast R-CNN [2] have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region\nproposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image\nconvolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional\nnetwork that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to\ngenerate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN\ninto a single network by sharing their convolutional features-using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with\n\"attention\" mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model [3],\nour detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection\naccuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image.

    "abstract": "Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine transla-\ntion. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine\ntranslation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to\nmaximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neu-\nral machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and encode\na source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a\ntranslation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a\nbottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architec-\nture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search\nfor parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without\nhaving to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach,\nwe achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art\nphrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore,\nqualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree\nwell with our intuition.",

Inspired by such successes, we adopt such\nan instruction-tuned LLM FLAN-T5 as the text encoder for text-to-audio (TTA)\ngeneration-a task where the goal is to generate an audio from its textual de-\nscription. The prior works on TTA either pre-trained a joint text-audio encoder\nor used a non-instruction-tuned model, such as, T5. Consequently, our latent dif-\nfusion model (LDM)-based approach (TANGO) outperforms the state-of-the-art\nAudioLDM on most metrics and stays comparable on the rest on AudioCaps test\nset, despite training the LDM on a 63 times smaller dataset and keeping the text\nencoder frozen. This improvement might also be attributed to the adoption of au-\ndio pressure level-based sound mixing for the training set augmentation, whereas\nthe prior methods take a random mix.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently\ndemonstrated an impressive ability to perform\narithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, when\nprovided with a few examples at test time (\"few-\nshot prompting\"). Much of this success can be\nattributed to prompting methods such as \"chain-\nof-thought\", which employ LLMs for both under-\nstanding the problem description by decomposing\nit into steps, as well as solving each step of the\nproblem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this\nsort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often\nmake logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solu-\ntion part, even when the problem is decomposed\ncorrectly. In this paper, we present Program-\nAided Language models (PAL): a novel approach\nthat uses the LLM to read natural language prob-\nlems and generate programs as the intermediate\nreasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a\nruntime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL,\ndecomposing the natural language problem into\nrunnable steps remains the only learning task for\nthe LLM, while solving is delegated to the inter-\npreter. We demonstrate this synergy between a\nneural LLM and a symbolic interpreter across 13\nmathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reason-\ning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and other bench-\nmarks. In all these natural language reasoning\ntasks, generating code using an LLM and rea-\nsoning using a Python interpreter leads to more\naccurate results than much larger models.
