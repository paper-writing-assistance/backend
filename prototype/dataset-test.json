      "abstract": "We present in this paper a new architecture, named Con-\nvolutional vision Transformer (CvT), that improves Vision\nTransformer (ViT) in performance and efficiency by intro-\nducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both de-\nsigns. This is accomplished through two primary modifica-\ntions: a hierarchy of Transformers containing a new convo-\nlutional token embedding, and a convolutional Transformer\nblock leveraging a convolutional projection. These changes\nintroduce desirable properties of convolutional neural net-\nworks (CNNs) to the ViT architecture (i.e. shift, scale,\nand distortion invariance) while maintaining the merits of\nTransformers (i.e. dynamic attention, global context, and\nbetter generalization). We validate CvT by conducting ex-\ntensive experiments, showing that this approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance over other Vision Transform-\ners and ResNets on ImageNet-1k, with fewer parame-\nters and lower FLOPs. In addition, performance gains\nare maintained when pretrained on larger datasets (e.g.\nImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream tasks. Pre-\ntrained on ImageNet-22k, our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 ac-\ncuracy of 87.7% on the ImageNet-1k val set. Finally, our\nresults show that the positional encoding, a crucial com-\nponent in existing Vision Transformers, can be safely re-\nmoved in our model, simplifying the design for higher res-\nolution vision tasks.

      "abstract": "This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are\nscalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our\nMAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the\ninput image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based\non two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric\nencoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that oper-\nates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask to-\nkens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs\nthe original image from the latent representation and mask\ntokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion\nof the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and\nmeaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two de-\nsigns enables us to train large models efficiently and ef-\nfectively: we accelerate training (by 3x or more) and im-\nprove accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning\nhigh-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla\nViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among\nmethods that use only ImageNet-1K data.

To address this issue, we develop the Cross-\nShaped Window self-attention mechanism for computing\nself-attention in the horizontal and vertical stripes in parallel\nthat form a cross-shaped window, with each stripe obtained\nby splitting the inputfeature into stripes of equal width.

The\nViT model splits each image into a sequence of tokens with\nfixed length and then applies multiple Transformer layers\nto model their global relation for classification. However,\nViT achieves inferior performance to CNNs when trained\nfrom scratch on a midsize dataset like ImageNet. We find\nit is because: 1) the simple tokenization of input images\nfails to model the important local structure such as edges\nand lines among neighboring pixels, leading to low train-\ning sample efficiency; 2) the redundant attention backbone\ndesign of ViT leads to limited feature richness for fixed com-\nputation budgets and limited training samples. To overcome\nsuch limitations, we propose a new Tokens-To-Token Vi-\nsion Transformer (T2T- ViT), which incorporates 1) a layer-\nwise Tokens-to-Token (T2T) transformation to progressively\nstructurize the image to tokens by recursively aggregating\nneighboring Tokens into one Token (Tokens-to-Token), such\nthat local structure represented by surrounding tokens can\nbe modeled and tokens length can be reduced; 2) an ef-\nficient backbone with a deep-narrow structure for vision\ntransformer motivated by CNN architecture design after\nempirical study.
