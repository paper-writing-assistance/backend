    "abstract": "We present in this paper a new architecture, named Con-\nvolutional vision Transformer (CvT), that improves Vision\nTransformer (ViT) in performance and efficiency by intro-\nducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both de-\nsigns. This is accomplished through two primary modifica-\ntions: a hierarchy of Transformers containing a new convo-\nlutional token embedding, and a convolutional Transformer\nblock leveraging a convolutional projection. These changes\nintroduce desirable properties of convolutional neural net-\nworks (CNNs) to the ViT architecture (i.e. shift, scale,\nand distortion invariance) while maintaining the merits of\nTransformers (i.e. dynamic attention, global context, and\nbetter generalization). We validate CvT by conducting ex-\ntensive experiments, showing that this approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance over other Vision Transform-\ners and ResNets on ImageNet-1k, with fewer parame-\nters and lower FLOPs. In addition, performance gains\nare maintained when pretrained on larger datasets (e.g.\nImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream tasks. Pre-\ntrained on ImageNet-22k, our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 ac-\ncuracy of 87.7% on the ImageNet-1k val set. Finally, our\nresults show that the positional encoding, a crucial com-\nponent in existing Vision Transformers, can be safely re-\nmoved in our model, simplifying the design for higher res-\nolution vision tasks.

    "abstract": "This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are\nscalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our\nMAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the\ninput image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based\non two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric\nencoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that oper-\nates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask to-\nkens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs\nthe original image from the latent representation and mask\ntokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion\nof the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and\nmeaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two de-\nsigns enables us to train large models efficiently and ef-\nfectively: we accelerate training (by 3x or more) and im-\nprove accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning\nhigh-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla\nViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among\nmethods that use only ImageNet-1K data.

A challenging issue in Transformer design is that\nglobal self-attention is very expensive to compute whereas\nlocal self-attention often limits the field of interactions of\neach token. To address this issue, we develop the Cross-\nShaped Window self-attention mechanism for computing\nself-attention in the horizontal and vertical stripes in parallel\nthat form a cross-shaped window, with each stripe obtained\nby splitting the inputfeature into stripes of equal width. We\nprovide a mathematical analysis of the effect of the stripe\nwidth and vary the stripe width for different layers of the\nTransformer network which achieves strong modeling capa-\nbility while limiting the computation cost. We also introduce\nLocally-enhanced Positional Encoding (LePE), which han-\ndles the local positional information better than existing\nencoding schemes. LePE naturally supports arbitrary input\nresolutions, and is thus especially effective and friendly for\ndownstream tasks. Incorporated with these designs and a hi-\nerarchical structure, CSWin Transformer demonstrates com-\npetitive performance on common vision tasks.

    "abstract": "Convolutional networks have been the paradigm of\nchoice in many computer vision applications. The convolu-\ntion operation however has a significant weakness in that it\nonly operates on a local neighborhood, thus missing global\ninformation. Self-attention, on the other hand, has emerged\nas a recent advance to capture long range interactions, but\nhas mostly been applied to sequence modeling and gener-\native modeling tasks. In this paper, we consider the use of\nself-attentionfor discriminative visual tasks as an alterna-\ntive to convolutions. We introduce a novel two-dimensional\nrelative self-attention mechanism that proves competitive\nin replacing convolutions as a stand-alone computational\nprimitive for image classification. We find in control exper-\niments that the best results are obtained when combining\nboth convolutions and self-attention. We therefore propose\nto augment convolutional operators with this self-attention\nmechanism by concatenating convolutional feature maps\nwith a set offeature maps produced via self-attention.

The\nViT model splits each image into a sequence of tokens with\nfixed length and then applies multiple Transformer layers\nto model their global relation for classification. However,\nViT achieves inferior performance to CNNs when trained\nfrom scratch on a midsize dataset like ImageNet. We find\nit is because: 1) the simple tokenization of input images\nfails to model the important local structure such as edges\nand lines among neighboring pixels, leading to low train-\ning sample efficiency; 2) the redundant attention backbone\ndesign of ViT leads to limited feature richness for fixed com-\nputation budgets and limited training samples. To overcome\nsuch limitations, we propose a new Tokens-To-Token Vi-\nsion Transformer (T2T- ViT), which incorporates 1) a layer-\nwise Tokens-to-Token (T2T) transformation to progressively\nstructurize the image to tokens by recursively aggregating\nneighboring Tokens into one Token (Tokens-to-Token), such\nthat local structure represented by surrounding tokens can\nbe modeled and tokens length can be reduced; 2) an ef-\nficient backbone with a deep-narrow structure for vision\ntransformer motivated by CNN architecture design after\nempirical study.

Conventional reference-\nbased metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE,\nhave been shown to have relatively low cor-\nrelation with human judgments, especially for\ntasks that require creativity and diversity. Re-\ncent studies suggest using large language mod-\nels (LLMs) as reference-free metrics for NLG\nevaluation, which have the benefit of being ap-\nplicable to new tasks that lack human refer-\nences. However, these LLM-based evaluators\nstill have lower human correspondence than\nmedium-size neural evaluators. In this work,\nwe present G-EVAL, a framework of using\nlarge language models with chain-of-thoughts\n(CoT) and a form-filling paradigm, to assess the\nquality of NLG outputs.

    "abstract": "Many NLP applications require manual text annotations for a variety of tasks, notably\nto train classifiers or evaluate the performance of unsupervised models. Depending\non the size and degree of complexity, the tasks may be conducted by crowd-workers\non platforms such as MTurk as well as trained annotators, such as research assistants.\nUsing four samples of tweets and news articles (n = 6,183), we show that ChatGPT\noutperforms crowd-workers for several annotation tasks, including relevance, stance,\ntopics, and frame detection. Across the four datasets, the zero-shot accuracy of\nChatGPT exceeds that of crowd-workers by about 25 percentage points on average,\nwhile ChatGPT's intercoder agreement exceeds that of both crowd-workers and\ntrained annotators for all tasks. Moreover, the per-annotation cost of ChatGPT is\nless than $0.003-about thirty times cheaper than MTurk. These results demonstrate\nthe potential of large language models to drastically increase the efficiency of text\nclassification.",

    "title": "PAL: Program-aided Language Models",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently\ndemonstrated an impressive ability to perform\narithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, when\nprovided with a few examples at test time (\"few-\nshot prompting\"). Much of this success can be\nattributed to prompting methods such as \"chain-\nof-thought\", which employ LLMs for both under-\nstanding the problem description by decomposing\nit into steps, as well as solving each step of the\nproblem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this\nsort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often\nmake logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solu-\ntion part, even when the problem is decomposed\ncorrectly. In this paper, we present Program-\nAided Language models (PAL): a novel approach\nthat uses the LLM to read natural language prob-\nlems and generate programs as the intermediate\nreasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a\nruntime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL,\ndecomposing the natural language problem into\nrunnable steps remains the only learning task for\nthe LLM, while solving is delegated to the inter-\npreter. We demonstrate this synergy between a\nneural LLM and a symbolic interpreter across 13\nmathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reason-\ning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and other bench-\nmarks. In all these natural language reasoning\ntasks, generating code using an LLM and rea-\nsoning using a Python interpreter leads to more\naccurate results than much larger models. For ex-\nample, PAL using CODEX achieves state-of-the-\nart few-shot accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark\nof math word problems, surpassing PaLM-540B\nwhich uses chain-of-thought by absolute 15% top-\n1. Our code and data are publicly available at\nhttp : / / reasonwithpal Â· com Â·",

      "summary": "PAL enhances LLMs by integrating with a Python interpreter to handle arithmetic and symbolic reasoning more accurately. This approach delegates execution to the interpreter after the LLM formulates problems as runnable code, achieving superior results on various reasoning tasks.",

    "abstract": "In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its\naccuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is\na thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with\nvery small (3 x 3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement\non the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19\nweight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014\nsubmission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisa-\ntion and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations\ngeneralise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results.

    "abstract": "We introduce segmental recurrent neural networks (SRNNs) which define,\ngiven an input sequence, a joint probability distribution over segmentations of\nthe input and labelings of the segments. Representations of the input segments\n(i.e., contiguous subsequences of the input) are computed by encoding their con-\nstituent tokens using bidirectional recurrent neural nets, and these \"segment em-\nbeddings\" are used to define compatibility scores with output labels. These lo-\ncal compatibility scores are integrated using a global semi-Markov conditional\nrandom field. Both fully supervised training-in which segment boundaries and\nlabels are observed -as well as partially supervised training-in which segment\nboundaries are latent-are straightforward.

Comparatively, unsupervised\nlearning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help\nbridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsuper-\nvised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative\nadversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and\ndemonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training\non various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolu-\ntional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to\nscenes in both the generator and discriminator.
